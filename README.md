## Introduction

Throughout this README you will find instructions on how to clone this repository, configure the npm settings and use browser-sync to automatically update the browser whenever a change is applied and saved. In addition to this, screenshots are visible further down to evidence what this bare bones grid looks like when viewed on both desktop and mobile.
